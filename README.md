# Men Deserve Shelter Too: A Repository for Justice and Reform

This repository exists as a response to the growing trend of gender-exclusive homeless services that actively displace men from their families, homes, and relationships based solely on unverified accusations—often rooted in emotional manipulation rather than objective harm.

This platform is born from personal history. My own father, who created a women-only homeless program, modeled a system of exclusion and hypocrisy. While he framed his actions as compassion, his motivations were personal dissatisfaction and infidelity, not justice. He banned men from his shelters, even in cases where the woman was the confirmed abuser. Meanwhile, my mother carried the financial weight of our family while he claimed moral authority. His legacy became a national architecture of hostility toward men and masculinity.

This repository is the beginning of a counter-narrative—a digital refuge, research hub, and activism archive for men wronged by biased systems. We believe in restoring fairness, dignity, and the presumption of innocence for all, regardless of gender. This is not just about advocacy—it's about reform. It's time to hold institutions accountable and rewrite the policies that rob men of their humanity under the guise of helping women.
